Challenge Module 1 HTML

In this challenge the objective was to Refactor a HTML file so it can be simpler to read.

I did some changes in the CSS file to shrink the size of the page by grouping them by clases.

Also I had to modify some measurements so it would fit and have similar traits than the original.

These are the changes I made:

    1.- I combine all the Benefits classes into 1 because the measurements and traits where the same. (IMGCSS0)
    2.- I combine all the Content classes into 1 because the measurements and traits where the same. (IMGCSS1)
    3.- I added a Footer color. (IMGCSS1)
